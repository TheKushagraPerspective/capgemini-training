STATIC MEMBER

*) it is also called as class members
1) static variable
    EXP: static int var_name;

2) static method
    EXP: static return_type mth_name(formal_args) {

    }

3) static initializer (static blocks)
    EXP: static {

    }


JVM ARCHITECTURE

1) Method Area

    Definition and Characterstics: 
        *) it only contains mth body / mth block / implementation block
        *) it will contain Static Method body/block
        *) it will contain Non-Static Method body/block
        *) it will contain Static Initializer body/block
        *) it will contain Non-Static Initializer body/block
        *) to call this jvm needs Reference ID which is present inside the class static Area
        *) structure: any method or initializer {
            // this block inside curly-braces will be stored in method area
        }

2) Class static Area

    Definition and Characterstics: 
        *) it only contains static members :- like static variable, static method, static initializer 
        *) structure will be:  class block -> className
                                        variables
                                        methods
                                        initializer
        *) here we will have only signatures like if we have a method then only method signature will be stored in this like mth-name + formal_args
        *) it will have Reference Id which will point to mth body that we have in mth area

3) Stack Area

    Definition and Characterstics: 
        *) it has frames/blocks.
        *) Execution always starts from this Stack area. bcz it creates frames for static members and after executing each frames, it destroy the frame imidiately. so out main method is nothing but a static member so it comes inside the static area.

4) Heap Area

    Definition and Characterstics: 
        *) it only contains non-static members :- like non-static variable, non-static method, non-static initializer 
        *) structure will be:  class block -> address
                                        variables
                                        methods
                                        initializer
        *) here we will have only signatures like if we have a method then only method signature will be stored in this like mth-name + formal_args
        *) it will have Reference Id which will point to mth body that we have in mth area


Note: we can call instance variable and methods from the class area without using main method, we can use multi-line static initializer to call these members. bcz when class is loaded in the class static area and when stack area starts execution then it will first execute multi-line static initializer before executing main method.

Note: Static members are called as "Single Copied Execution".


CLASS

Definition and Characterstics:-
    *) It is a blue print of object. Multiple objects can be created of the class. We can declare multiple objects with same name and we call it as identical/similar objects. Each object work independentely in a class and if one object gets destroyed then it won't affect the other objects.

OBJECTS

Definition and Characterstics:-
    *) It is an instance of the class. Anything which is physically present is nothing but objects. Objects have attributes and behaviour, and are set of informations.


NON-STATIC MEMBERS
    Definition and Characterstics:- 
        *) Any member like variable, method, initializer, and constructor is not prefixed with the keyword Static then all these members are called as non-static members.
        *) These are also called as instance members.

    *) Instance variables
    *) methods
    *) Non-Static initializer
    *) Constructor


Instanciation :- Address for the class.
Car c1 = new Car(); :- 'new Car()' is nothing but the Anonymous Object and it instanciate the class means it will generate the block of memory inside the heap area.
                        new keyword is used to generate the unique address/block of memory and that address will be stored in heap area.
                        when we declare/use new keyword then at that time only it will generate the block of memory in heap area and in that heap area it will have all non-static members.
                        'new ClassName()' will generate new and unique address will be generate every time.
                        Car c1 :- is nothing but the object reference and c1 is object reference name. and by the reference name only we call the members multiple times from the class.


Note:- Multi-line static initializer will automatically call by the jvm when the class is loaded in class static area and we don't need to call it from main method and first it will execute and then main method will execute but in Multi-line non-static initializer when we craete the object of that class in the main method then after creating the object, MLNSI will be called automatically. first MLNSI will execute and then constructor.

Non-Static variables are also called as :- attributes, fields, data members , instance variable, object variables
Non-Static methods are also called as :- behaviour, instance of the methods

Q:- what is relative and absolute path?



CONSTRUCTOR

    *) special method, and similar to methods we have
    *) present inside the class area.
    *) the name of the constructor shoule be same as class name
    *) used to initialized the objects
    *) doesn't have any return type, doesn't have modifier, but have access-modifier

Three types of constructor:- 
    1) default constructor
        *) if user doesn't define any constructor then compiler will create a default constructor.
        *) it doesn't have any instruction and statement
        *) it is used to provide the defaults value to instance variables
    2) parameterised constructor
        *) user-defined constructor means user/programmer created the constructor.
        *) the user-defined constructor will have formal_arguments
    3) non-parameterised constructor
        *) user-defined constructor means user/programmer created the constructor.
        *) the user-defined constructor will not have formal_arguments


COUPLING

Definition:- how strongly one class  depends on another class
High dependency :- tight coupling
Low dependency :- loose coupling

Tight Coupling :- two class are tightly coupled if :-
                        one class directly dependent on the implementation of the other class
                        changes in one class force changes in another

Loose Coupling :- two class are loosely coupled if :-
                        one class does not directly dependent on the implementation of the other class
                        changes in one class does not affect the changes in another



RELATIONSHIP

1) HAS - A relationship

    one class contains or uses another class as a part of it.

    *) Association
        :-) both class uses each other
        :-) both class objects can exist independentely
    *) Aggregation
        :-) one class has another class
        :-) child class object can exist independentely
        :-) loose coupling
        :-) not having blood-relationship
        :-) flexible
    *) Composition
        :-) child class object can't exist independentely
        :-) lifetime of child class is totally dependent on parent class
        :-) tight coupling
        :-) having blood-relationship

2) IS - A relationship
    *) the relation btw two class objects (parent class and child class) is known as IS - A relationship.


Aggregation:- 
    Dependent class
        *) 
    Associated class or Instance of the class
        *) inside this class we will create dependent class object to use/call the members of the dependent class


Bean or JavaBean :-
