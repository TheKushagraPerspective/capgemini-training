TYPECASTING

Primitive typecasting (Not recommended)
    Widening (implicit call)
        Converting smaller range primitive dt into higher range primitive dt
        This is done implicitly done by the compiler
        Byte < short <->char < int < long < float < double
        Note:- boolean can’t be typecast
        Float is considered greater than long when it comes to implicit typecasting
        Char -> int possible bcz compiler knows the ascii value of characters but int -> char not possible (primitive DT -> char not possible)
    Narrowing (explicit call)
        Converting higher range primitive dt into smaller range primitive dt
        This is done by programmer only
        Double > float > long > int > short <-> char > byte
        This is done using typecast operator
        Syntax :- smaller-primitive-dt varName = (smaller-primitive-dt) higher-primitive-dt-var
        Here we can convert num to character explicitly
Non-Primitive typecasting (highly recommended)



SCANNER CLASS

Use to take inputs from the user/programmer
    Steps:- 
        Import java.util.Scanner;    util -> package , Scanner -> class
        Declare Scanner class object
        It can be declared inside class block as well as method block
        Syntax :- Scanner objRefName = new Scanner(System.in);
    In-build methods of the Scanner class
        nextByte()
        nextShort()
        nextInt()
        nextLong()
        nextFloat()
        nextDouble()
        nextBoolean()
        next().charAt(0)    -> to take character as a input
        next()		     -> to take a single word as a input
        nextLine()	     -> to take group of words as a input
