Parent Class
    *) called as Generalized class
    *) Base class
    *) Super class
Child Class
    *) called as Specialized class
    *) Derived class
    *) Sub class


Inheritance :- the process of acquiring the properties from one class into another class is known as Inheritance.

5 Types of Inheritance :- 
    *) Single level Inheritance
    *) Multi level Inheritance
    *) Multiple Inheritance
    *) Hierarchical Inheritance
    *) Hybrid Inheritance


Super Keyword:- *) it is used to access the properties and behaviour of the super class
                *) it can't access the address of super class 
                *) to differentiate btw properties of super class and sub class, we use super keyword
                *) we can use super keyword multiple time in constructor block and in mth block
Super call statement:- 
                *) it is used to call/initialize the super class constructor
                *) it must be the first statement inside the constructor of the sub class
                *) by default super call statement is there inside the constructor if not defined by the user
                *) used to call the constructor of the Object class
                *) if the parent class is having a constructor then it is required to declare the constructor in sub class.
                *) it should be declared inside the constructor block not in mth block
                *) only one super call statement is possible inside the constructor blocks

This keyword:- 
                *) it is used to access the properties of the current class.
                *) it consist current class address. we can able to get the current class address using this keyword.
                *) we can use this keyword multiple time in constructor block and in mth block
This call statement:-
                *) it should be declared inside the constructor block not in mth block
                *) only one this call statement is possible inside the constructor blocks

Note:- we cannot use this() call statement and super() call statement together in the same block


Multiple Inheritance :-
    *) java does not allow to perform multiple inheritance because it cause ambiguity and it is nothing but the diamond problem.
    *) bcz if the name of the properties or behaviour is same in both super class then compiler will confuse like which super class properties or behavious he was asked to call.



POLYMORPHISM

one object is going to behave in multiple behaviours is known as polymorphism.
Types:-
    *) Compiler time polymorphism (static poly / early binding)
        binding achieved during compile time 
        *) Overloading
            *) method Overloading
            *) constructor Overloading
            *) public, private, protected, non-static, static, final mths can be overloaded

        *) Shadowing
            *) to do this, we need to have static var and mth
            *) variable
            *) method

    *) Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic poly / late binding)
        binding achieved during on runtime
        *) Overriding
            *) method Overriding
            *) public, non-static mths can be overridden, but static, privates, and final mths cannot be overridden.

Polymorphism:

An object showing different behavior and different status of action is known as polymorphism,
There are two type of polymorphism:
1) Compile time polymorphism
2) Runtime polymorphism

1. Compile Time Polymorphism:

In compile time polymorphism the method declaration is binded to the method definition at compile time by compiler.
Since the binding is happening at operation time it is known as compile time binding or static binding or early binding,
for overloaded methods ,static methods and final methods compile time binding happens. 

Method Overloading:

Defining multiple methods in a class with same name and different arguments is known as method overloading.
This should work either in an argument type or a length of the argument

 In class we can overload both static method and non-static methods
 The overloaded methods are executed based on the method arguments
 Method overloading is used to achieved compile time polymorphism

When we go for Method Overloading?
While develop an application or function if the come cross an operation to be perform with different parameters
then we go for method overloading.

Constructor Overloading:
In a class defining multiple constructor with different parameters is known as constructor overloading
 When defining overloading constructor the constructor should deferent in terms of parameter type or parameter
length.
 Constructor overloading help us to create an instance of class to the different initialization.
 While defining a constructor the constructor name should be same as class name, and constructor should not
have return type.


Runtime polymorphism:
*In java runtime polymorphism the method declaration is binded to the method definition by the JVM during execution. 
*Since binding is happening at runtime it is known as dynamic binding or late binding. 
*To Achieve runtime polymorphism we have to Go with
  -->Inheritance
  -->Method overriding
  -->Non primitive typecasting

Method Overriding:
-->method overriding We can Achieve runtime polymorphism.
Inheriting in a method on super class changing in the implementation in sub class is known as method overriding.

-->To override the method inheritance is must.
-->When sub class overrides the method of the super class then sub class should rewrite the same method signature of the super class, it should change the implementation.

Not possible to Override:
-->static method is not possible to override.
-->final non static method is not possible
-->private non static method is not possible.
