OPERATORS

1. Unary Operator

    Unary operators work on a single operand.

    Increment Operator

        Pre-Increment: ++var
        → Increments the value first, then uses it.

        Post-Increment: var++
        → Uses the value first, then increments it.

    Decrement Operator

        Pre-Decrement: --var
        → Decrements the value first, then uses it.

        Post-Decrement: var--
        → Uses the value first, then decrements it.

    Logical NOT Operator

        ! (negates the boolean value)

2. Binary Operator

    Binary operators work on two operands.

    Arithmetic Operators

        + (Addition)

        - (Subtraction)

        * (Multiplication)

        / (Division)

    Relational Operators (Comparison Operators)

        < , > , <= , >= , == , !=

    Logical AND / OR Operators

        && (Logical AND)

        || (Logical OR)

3. Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)

    Syntax: ? :

    Used as a shorthand for if-else.

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Q1. Difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types
    Primitive Data Types

        Inbuilt data types

        Fixed size

        Store actual values

        Examples: int, float, double, char, boolean

    Non-Primitive Data Types

        User-defined or reference data types

        Size is not fixed

        Store reference/address

        Examples: String, Array, Class, Object

Q2. Difference between Local and Global Variables
    Local Variables

        Declared inside methods or blocks

        Accessible only within that block

        Must be initialized before use

    Global Variables (Instance / Class Variables)

        Declared inside the class but outside methods

        Accessible throughout the class

        Automatically initialized with default values

Q3. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter
    Compiler

        Translates entire high-level code into machine code at once

        Generates executable code

        Faster execution after compilation

        Example: C, C++

    Interpreter

        Executes code line by line

        No separate executable file

        Slower execution

        Example: JavaScript, Python

Q4. Difference between Platform Independent and Platform Dependent
    Platform Independent

        Code can run on any operating system

        Java compiles code into bytecode

        Bytecode runs on any system using JVM

        Example: Java

    Platform Dependent

        Executable code is OS-specific

        Cannot run on other platforms without recompiling

        Example: C, C++

Q5. How does Object-Oriented nature of Java help in software development?

    Provides modularity using classes and objects

    Supports reusability through inheritance

    Improves maintainability and scalability

    Helps in better code organization

Q6. Why is Java considered simpler than C or C++?

    No pointers

    Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection)

    Simple syntax

    No multiple inheritance using classes

Q7. How does Java provide security at runtime?

    Bytecode verification

    JVM security manager

    No direct memory access

    ClassLoader security

Q8. What makes Java a robust language?

    Strong memory management

    Exception handling

    Garbage collection

    Strong type checking

Q9. How does Java achieve high performance?

    Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler

    Converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime

Q10. What do you mean by portability in Java?

    “Write Once, Run Anywhere”

    Bytecode runs on any system with JVM

Q11. Why does Java have strong industry adoption and job opportunities?

    Platform independent

    Large ecosystem

    Used in web, mobile, enterprise, and backend systems

    Strong community support

OPERATOR RULES (TYPE PROMOTION)

When performing operations on the same data type and storing the result in the same data type:

    DT1	    DT2	    Result
    byte	byte	CTE
    short	short	CTE
    int	    int	    Success
    float	float	Success
    double	double	Success
    long	long	Success
    char	char	CTE
    String	String	Concatenation
    
ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR

    Assignment happens from right to left

        Operator: =

    Compound Assignment Operators

        (Combination of arithmetic + assignment)

        +=

        -=

        *=

        /=

        %=

RELATIONAL OPERATOR

    Type: Binary operator

    Return type: boolean

    Operates on two operands

    Supported Symbols

        < , > , <= , >= , == , !=

    Rules

    Numeric & char → support all operators
    Examples:

    'A' > 65

    100.5 <= 101

    190 == 'L'

    97 >= 'a'

    String & boolean → only == and !=
    Valid:

    "Hello" == "hello"

    true != false
    Invalid:

    "Str" >= "str"

LOGICAL OPERATOR

    Relational operator is mandatory

    Operates on boolean conditions

    Return type must be boolean

    Types

        Logical AND: &&

        Logical OR: ||

        Logical NOT: !

        Example
        (a > b) && (c < d)
